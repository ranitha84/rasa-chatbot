# Restaurant Chat Bot

## Problem Statement
    An Indian startup named 'Foodie' wants to build a conversational bot (chatbot) which can help users discover restaurants across several Indian cities.
    The main purpose of the bot is to help users discover restaurants quickly and efficiently and to provide a good restaurant discovery experience. 

    The bot takes the following inputs from the user:
    - City: Take the input from the customer as a text field. 
    - Cuisine Preference: Take the cuisine preference from the customer. The bot should list out six cuisine categories to choose from
    - Average budget for two people: Segment the price range (average budget for two people) into three price categories: lesser than 300, 300 to 700 and more than 700. 
    
    While showing the results to the user, the bot should display the top 5 restaurants in a sorted order (descending) of the average Zomato user rating (on a scale of 1-5, 5 being the highest). 
    Finally, the bot should ask the user whether he/she wants the details of the top 10 restaurants on email. 
    If the user replies 'yes', the bot should ask for userï¿½s email id and then send it over email. Else, just reply with a 'goodbye' message. 

### Working Example :
    ```
        Your input ->  Hi

        Bot -> Hey, How is it going. How May I help you Today
